BTCSquared
==========

BTCSquared* is the result of the Bitcoin 2013 Conference Hackathon, San Jose, on May 17-19. 

The result a first draft of a Bluetooth Low Energy based Bitcoin transaction protocol to simplify Bitcoin transactions between people in the same room. 

The protocol enables discovery of other people with the ability to send or receive Bitcoins using this system and a very simple transaction mechanism to improve usre experience. 

As of the current version (v0.01) it's mostly a UX concept. 

Big thanks to Robohash.org for an amazingly awesome service! Made my hackathon presentation way more awesome.
